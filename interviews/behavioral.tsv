What is the STAR method?	A framework for answering behavioral questions:<br>Situation — context and background.<br>Task — your responsibility or goal.<br>Action — specific steps you took.<br>Result — the outcome and what you learned.
How do you answer "Tell me about yourself"?	Give a 1-2 minute professional summary: current role/background → key experiences relevant to the role → why you're excited about this opportunity. Avoid personal details; stay career-focused.
How do you answer "What is your greatest weakness"?	Name a real (but non-critical) weakness, describe concrete steps you're taking to improve it, and show growth. Avoid clichés like "I work too hard."
How do you answer "Tell me about a time you failed"?	Use STAR: describe a real failure, own your role in it, focus on what you learned and changed afterward. Interviewers want self-awareness and growth, not perfection.
How do you answer "Why do you want to work here"?	Show research: mention something specific about the company's mission, product, culture, or technology. Connect it to your skills and goals. Avoid generic answers like "good reputation."
How do you answer "Where do you see yourself in 5 years"?	Show ambition aligned with the role. Focus on skills you want to develop and contributions you want to make, not a specific title. Connect your goals to what the company offers.
How do you answer "Tell me about a conflict with a coworker"?	Use STAR. Focus on professional disagreements (not personal conflicts), show how you listened and communicated, and emphasize the resolution and relationship outcome. Avoid blaming others.
How do you answer "Describe a time you led a project"?	Use STAR. Highlight how you organized the team, handled obstacles, made decisions, and delivered results. Quantify impact if possible (e.g., "reduced build time by 40%").
How do you answer "Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly"?	Use STAR. Describe the situation requiring fast learning, your specific strategies (documentation, mentors, prototyping), and how you applied the knowledge successfully.
How do you answer "How do you handle competing priorities"?	Describe your system: assessing urgency/impact, communicating trade-offs to stakeholders, and adjusting as priorities shift. Give a concrete example using STAR.
How do you answer "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"?	Show that you raised your concern respectfully with data/reasoning, listened to their perspective, and either reached alignment or committed to the decision. Avoid appearing insubordinate.
How do you answer "Give an example of going above and beyond"?	Use STAR to show initiative that created impact beyond your job description. Focus on the judgment to identify the opportunity and the outcome it produced.
What questions should you ask at the end of an interview?	Ask about: team culture and day-to-day work, biggest technical challenges, how success is measured in this role, opportunities for growth, next steps in the process. Avoid asking about salary/benefits first.
How do you answer "Why are you leaving your current job"?	Stay positive. Frame it as seeking growth, new challenges, or a better fit — not escaping a bad situation. Never speak negatively about your current employer.
How do you answer "What is your greatest strength"?	Name a genuine strength relevant to the role, give a specific example, and connect it to the value you'd bring. Avoid vague claims like "I'm a hard worker" without evidence.
How do you handle "Tell me about a time you worked under pressure"?	Use STAR. Highlight the specific pressure (deadline, scope, stakes), your approach to prioritization and calm decision-making, and the successful outcome.
What is the difference between a behavioral and situational question?	Behavioral: "Tell me about a time you..." — asks about past experience to predict future behavior.<br>Situational: "What would you do if..." — asks how you'd handle a hypothetical scenario.
How do you discuss salary expectations?	Research the market range (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, LinkedIn). Give a range anchored above your minimum. Express flexibility while emphasizing fit: "I'm targeting X–Y, but I'm open depending on the full package."
How do you answer "What motivates you"?	Be honest and specific. Tie motivation to what the role offers (solving hard problems, user impact, collaboration, learning). Vague answers like "I like challenges" don't stand out.
How do you close an interview?	Reiterate your enthusiasm for the role, briefly summarize why you're a strong fit, and confirm next steps. Send a thank-you email within 24 hours referencing a specific conversation point.
