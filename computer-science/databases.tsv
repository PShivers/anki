What is a relational database?	A database that organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are expressed via foreign keys. Uses SQL.
What is a primary key?	A column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Cannot be NULL and must be unique.
What is a foreign key?	A column in one table that references the primary key of another table, enforcing referential integrity between related tables.
What is normalization?	The process of organizing a database schema to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity. Each normal form (1NF–BCNF) eliminates specific types of anomalies.
What is 1NF (First Normal Form)?	Every column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and each row is unique. No repeating groups or arrays within a column.
What is 2NF (Second Normal Form)?	In 1NF, and every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key (no partial dependencies).
What is 3NF (Third Normal Form)?	In 2NF, and no non-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key (non-key attributes depend only on the key).
What is an index?	A data structure (commonly a B-tree) that speeds up row lookups on a column at the cost of extra storage and slower writes.
What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?	Clustered: rows are physically stored in index order — one per table, fastest for range queries.<br>Non-clustered: a separate structure pointing to rows — multiple allowed, adds a lookup step.
What is a transaction?	A unit of work that is executed atomically. Either all operations succeed and are committed, or all are rolled back if any fail.
What are the ACID properties?	Atomicity — all or nothing.<br>Consistency — database moves from one valid state to another.<br>Isolation — concurrent transactions don't interfere.<br>Durability — committed changes survive crashes.
What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking?	Pessimistic: lock the resource before reading/writing to prevent conflicts.<br>Optimistic: read without locking, check for conflicts at commit time and retry if needed.
What are the SQL transaction isolation levels?	Read Uncommitted → Read Committed → Repeatable Read → Serializable. Higher levels prevent more anomalies (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads) at the cost of concurrency.
What is a JOIN in SQL?	Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Types: INNER JOIN (matching rows only), LEFT/RIGHT JOIN (all rows from one side), FULL OUTER JOIN (all rows from both).
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?	WHERE filters rows before aggregation; HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY aggregation.
What is a view?	A virtual table defined by a stored query. Simplifies complex queries and can restrict column/row access without duplicating data.
What is a stored procedure?	A named, precompiled SQL routine stored in the database. Accepts parameters, can contain logic, and is called by name to reduce repetitive SQL.
What is the N+1 query problem?	When fetching N records and then issuing one additional query per record to load related data, causing N+1 total queries. Fixed with eager loading (JOIN or IN clause).
What is the CAP theorem?	In a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of three: Consistency (all nodes see the same data), Availability (every request gets a response), Partition tolerance (system works despite network splits).
What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?	SQL: structured, relational, ACID, fixed schema. Best for complex queries and relations.<br>NoSQL: flexible schema, horizontal scaling, various models (document, key-value, column, graph). Best for high throughput and unstructured data.
