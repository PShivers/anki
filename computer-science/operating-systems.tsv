What is a process?	An independent program in execution with its own memory space, file handles, and system resources. Managed by the OS scheduler.
What is a thread?	The smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads share the same memory and resources of their parent process but run independently.
What is the difference between a process and a thread?	Processes are isolated with separate memory spaces; threads share memory within a process. Thread creation and context switching are cheaper than processes.
What is a context switch?	The OS saving the state of one process/thread and restoring the state of another so the CPU can switch between tasks.
What is a scheduler?	The OS component that decides which process/thread runs on the CPU and for how long. Common algorithms: FIFO, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, MLFQ.
What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?	Preemptive: OS can interrupt a running process and switch to another.<br>Non-preemptive: a process runs until it voluntarily yields or blocks.
What is a deadlock?	A state where two or more processes are each waiting for a resource held by the other, so none can proceed. Requires: mutual exclusion, hold-and-wait, no preemption, circular wait.
What are the four Coffman conditions for deadlock?	1. Mutual exclusion — resources are non-shareable<br>2. Hold and wait — processes hold resources while waiting for more<br>3. No preemption — resources can't be forcibly taken<br>4. Circular wait — a cycle of processes each waiting on the next
What is a mutex?	A mutual exclusion lock that ensures only one thread can access a critical section at a time. Must be unlocked by the thread that locked it.
What is a semaphore?	A synchronization primitive with a counter. Binary semaphore (0/1) acts like a mutex; counting semaphore controls access to a pool of N resources.
What is a race condition?	When the outcome of a program depends on the non-deterministic ordering of operations by concurrent threads, leading to unpredictable bugs.
What is virtual memory?	An abstraction that gives each process the illusion of a large, private address space. Pages are mapped to physical RAM or swapped to disk as needed.
What is paging?	Dividing virtual memory into fixed-size pages and physical memory into frames. The OS maps pages to frames via a page table, enabling non-contiguous physical storage.
What is a page fault?	Occurs when a process accesses a page not currently in physical RAM. The OS loads the page from disk (swap) into a free frame and resumes execution.
What is thrashing?	When the OS spends more time swapping pages in and out than executing processes, usually due to insufficient physical RAM for the working set of active processes.
What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?	Internal: wasted space inside an allocated block (block is larger than needed).<br>External: enough total free space exists but it's split into non-contiguous chunks that can't satisfy a request.
What is a system call?	An interface through which a user-space program requests a service from the OS kernel (e.g., file I/O, process creation, network access). Crosses the user/kernel boundary.
What is the difference between user mode and kernel mode?	Kernel mode: full hardware access, runs OS code.<br>User mode: restricted access, runs application code. A system call switches from user to kernel mode.
What is an interrupt?	A signal to the CPU from hardware or software indicating an event needs immediate attention. The CPU suspends current execution, runs the interrupt handler, then resumes.
What is the difference between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel?	Monolithic: entire OS runs in kernel space — fast but less modular (Linux).<br>Microkernel: minimal kernel; most services run in user space — more modular but slower due to IPC overhead.
