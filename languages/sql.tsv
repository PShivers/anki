What is the order of SQL clause execution?	FROM → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → DISTINCT → ORDER BY → LIMIT
What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?	INNER JOIN: returns only rows with matches in both tables.<br>LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right; NULLs where there's no match.
What is a FULL OUTER JOIN?	Returns all rows from both tables. Where there's no match on either side, the missing columns are filled with NULL.
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?	WHERE filters individual rows before grouping.<br>HAVING filters aggregated groups after GROUP BY. HAVING can use aggregate functions; WHERE cannot.
What does GROUP BY do?	Collapses rows with the same value in the specified column(s) into a single row, allowing aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) to be applied per group.
What is a subquery?	A query nested inside another query. Can appear in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses. Correlated subqueries reference the outer query and run once per outer row.
What is a CTE (Common Table Expression)?	A named temporary result defined with WITH clause before the main query. Improves readability and can be referenced multiple times. Recursive CTEs can traverse hierarchies.
What is a window function?	Performs a calculation across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing them. Uses OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...). Examples: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD(), SUM().
What is the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK()?	RANK(): assigns the same rank to ties but skips the next rank(s) — 1,1,3.<br>DENSE_RANK(): assigns the same rank to ties without gaps — 1,1,2.
What does ROW_NUMBER() do?	Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition, ordered by the specified ORDER BY. No ties — each row gets a distinct number.
What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?	UNION: combines result sets and removes duplicate rows.<br>UNION ALL: combines result sets keeping all duplicates. UNION ALL is faster as it skips deduplication.
What does DISTINCT do?	Removes duplicate rows from the result set. SELECT DISTINCT col returns only unique values for that column.
What is an index and how does it affect queries?	A B-tree (or other) structure that speeds up lookups on a column. Speeds up SELECT with WHERE/ORDER BY but slows INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE due to index maintenance.
What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?	DELETE: removes specific rows — can be rolled back, fires triggers, slower.<br>TRUNCATE: removes all rows fast — minimal logging, usually not rollback-able.<br>DROP: removes the entire table structure and data.
What is a NULL in SQL and how do you test for it?	NULL represents an unknown or missing value. Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL — never = NULL, as NULL = NULL evaluates to NULL (unknown), not true.
What does COALESCE do?	Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of arguments. COALESCE(a, b, c) returns a if not null, else b, else c. Useful for providing defaults.
What is a self join?	A join of a table with itself. Used to compare rows within the same table or traverse hierarchical data (e.g., employee and manager in the same table).
What does EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) do?	Shows the query execution plan — how the database will (or did) execute the query, including index usage, join strategies, and estimated/actual row counts. Essential for performance tuning.
What is a transaction and how do you use it in SQL?	A block of statements executed atomically: BEGIN; ... COMMIT; or ROLLBACK; if something fails. Ensures ACID properties across multiple statements.
What is the difference between a correlated and non-correlated subquery?	Non-correlated: the subquery runs once independently and its result is used by the outer query.<br>Correlated: the subquery references the outer query and runs once for each outer row — can be slow.
