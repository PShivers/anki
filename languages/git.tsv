What does git init do?	Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden .git folder to track history.
What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?	git fetch: downloads remote changes but does not merge them into your working branch.<br>git pull: fetches and immediately merges (or rebases) the remote changes into the current branch.
What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?	merge: creates a new merge commit combining two branches — preserves full history.<br>rebase: replays your commits on top of another branch — produces a linear history but rewrites commits.
What does git stash do?	Temporarily saves uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) so you can switch branches or pull without committing. Restore with git stash pop or git stash apply.
What is a detached HEAD state?	When HEAD points directly to a commit instead of a branch. Commits made in this state are not on any branch and can be lost unless a new branch is created.
What does git reset do?	Moves the current branch pointer to a specified commit.<br>--soft: keeps changes staged.<br>--mixed (default): unstages changes.<br>--hard: discards all changes permanently.
What is the difference between git reset and git revert?	git reset: rewrites history by moving the branch pointer — unsafe on shared branches.<br>git revert: creates a new commit that undoes a previous commit — safe for shared branches.
What does git cherry-pick do?	Applies the changes from a specific commit onto the current branch, creating a new commit with the same changes but a different hash.
What is a fast-forward merge?	When the target branch has no new commits since the feature branch diverged, Git simply moves the branch pointer forward — no merge commit is created.
What does git reflog do?	Records every change to HEAD, including resets and branch switches. Useful for recovering commits that appear lost after a reset or rebase.
What is a Git tag?	A named reference to a specific commit. Lightweight tags are just pointers; annotated tags store a message and tagger info. Used to mark release versions (e.g., v1.0.0).
What does git bisect do?	Performs a binary search through commit history to find the commit that introduced a bug. You mark commits as good or bad; git bisect narrows down to the offending commit.
What is the staging area (index)?	An intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. git add moves changes to the staging area; git commit records staged changes into history.
What does git diff do?	Shows differences between working directory and staging area (git diff), staged changes vs last commit (git diff --cached), or between two commits/branches.
What is a .gitignore file?	A file specifying patterns for files and directories Git should not track. Patterns are matched against file paths relative to the .gitignore location.
What does git log --oneline --graph do?	Displays commit history as a compact one-line-per-commit ASCII graph showing branch and merge structure.
What is the difference between origin and upstream?	origin: your fork or primary remote (default name after git clone).<br>upstream: the original repository your fork was created from. Convention, not enforced by Git.
What does git remote -v show?	Lists all configured remote repositories and their fetch/push URLs.
What is an interactive rebase (git rebase -i)?	Lets you edit, squash, reorder, or drop commits in a range before they are applied. Useful for cleaning up history before merging a feature branch.
What does git blame do?	Shows the commit and author that last modified each line of a file. Useful for understanding why code was written a certain way.
